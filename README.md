This is an example of how to use signed fixed actions order in 0xcert framework v2.

The example is wrapped in a simple dApp to showcase not only functionalities but also the basic principles of handling blockchain communication through 0xcert framework. Main logic is isolated in `src/example.ts` while response handling is located in `index.ts`. The basic configuration needed for communication can be found in `src/config.ts` file.

To keep the example as simple as possible there are some hardcoded values like order definition. You can change those in `src/config.ts`.

There are also some empty variables in `src/config.ts` that you need to set so that the example works. Mainly assetLedgerId which you got when you deployed a new asset ledger in the asset management guide and two metamask accounts (account1Id, account2Id) where the first account has to be the one that deployed the asset ledger and the second can be anyone.
