This is an example of how to use the signed fixed actions order within the 0xcert Framework v2.

The example is put in the context of a simple dApp to showcase not only functionalities but also the basic principles of handling blockchain communication through the 0xcert Framework. The main logic is isolated in the `src/example.ts` file while response handling is located in `index.ts`. The basic configuration needed for communication can be found in the `src/config.ts` file.

To keep the example as simple as possible, some values are hardcoded, such as order definition. You can change those in the `src/config.ts` file.

The `src/config.ts` file also contains some empty variables that you need to set for the example to work. Mainly, the assetLedgerId, which you got at deploying a new asset ledger in the asset management guide, and two MetaMask accounts (account1Id, account2Id), where the first account must be the one that deployed the asset ledger and the second account can represent anyone.
